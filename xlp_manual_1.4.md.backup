What is XLP?
============

XLP stands for **Extreme Learning Process**, a methodology that lets
communities of learners design and conduct collaborative learning
activities. Taking a look more closely at the name:

-   **Extreme:** XLP explores frontiers, identifies boundaries, and
    helps participants push those boundaries.
-   **Learning:** XLP enables individual learning, group learning, and
    large-scale [crowd learning](crowd_learning "wikilink").
-   **Process:** XLP has a clear process, through which participants
    prepare, deploy, and execute missions.

We aim to become a crowd-learning system that facilitates [collective
learning](collective_learning "wikilink") in this increasingly complex
world. Learners are empowered to work together within and between teams,
and incorporate both digital and physical elements.

Due to advancing technology, educational institutions can now operate in
ways unthinkable only a few years ago. This is because today it is
possible to collect and process organizational behavior data in ways
that were impossible before. Therefore XLP is not merely about improving
individual learning, but also *measuring and improving organizational
learning*.

XLP in a Nutshell
-----------------

XLP is a process with **inputs**, **outputs**, **activities**, and
**effects**:

### Inputs

-   Sponsors and groups of [participants](#Participants "wikilink"), who
    become [mission designers](#mission_designers "wikilink") and
    [mission executors](#mission_executors "wikilink"). These
    participants come together for a specific learning objective and
    duration.
-   [Resources](#Resources "wikilink") such as hackerspaces, campuses,
    mentoring, etc.

### Activities

-   [Mission](#Missions "wikilink") based learning, which is designed
    and executed by groups of participants. Each mission uses gamified
    techniques to impart valuable knowledge and skills with real-world
    applications.
-   [Digital publishing](Digital_publishing "wikilink") of all
    activities and results, in the form of [containers of
    knowledge](#containers_of_knowledge "wikilink"), via our
    [Remix](#Remix:_The_XLP_Online_Platform "wikilink") suite of tools.

### Outputs

-   Containers of knowledge, carrying a full record of participant
    activity, and able to be read, shared and deployed with ease
-   Knowledge and skills transfer
-   Credentials and qualifications, stored on the Blockchain. Access can
    be granted to selected employers and institutions to prove
    participants expertise.
-   Crowd Learning, i.e. large scale collaboration on learning missions.

### Effects

For participants:

-   Real world decisions: XLP challenges participants to make financial,
    legal, cultural and technical decisions, so they can achieve goals
    set by the participant groups themselves.
-   Real world experience: XLP is pragmatic. The XLP method induces
    realistic human dynamics, utilizes modern technologies, encourages
    participants to create social norms, and establishes executable
    regulations based on the design principles of the fast-evolving
    Internet.
-   Tapping potential: XLP drives participants to realize their untapped
    potentials and emerging powers of collaboration through having them
    stretch the educational envelope by shifting the focus from teaching
    (top-down) to learning (bottom-up).

For educators and institutions:

-   No-one left behind: XLP encourages an evolutionary process, which
    creates a digitally enabled learning context that delivers rich
    social-interactions and leaves no-one behind.
-   Curating, not teaching: By placing participants in control of
    learning, XLP redefines educators\' roles as curators of learning
    resources and as evaluators of participants\' learning-potentials.
-   Deeper, richer data: XLP provides network-enabled learning data
    management technology that enables stakeholders to record, analyze
    and identify learning trajectories to define new directions for
    progress.

A Short History of XLP
----------------------

Since June 2012, XLP-based orientation programs and semester-long
courses have been conducted at:

-   [Tsinghua University](Tsinghua_University "wikilink"), Beijing
-   National Taiwan University of Science and Technology
-   Singapore University of Technology and Design
-   Taylor\'s University, Malaysia
-   Eurasia University, Xi\'an
-   Tianjin Vocational College of Mechanics and Electricity

Courses have also been conducted at many leading high schools in China.
Due to XLP\'s experimental success, China\'s Ministry of Education has
invited the founder of XLP to serve on the Design Committee of National
Curriculum Standards on Technology Education, with the goal of rolling
out XLP as a learning architecture and a learning activity design
methodology for over 300 million registered students in the Chinese
education system.

XLP is scalable and applicable to a broad range of students. A teacher
from Tianjin Vocational College of Mechanics and Electricity stated his
observation:

\"In the past, I could only judge students\' quality by their test
scores. However, after seeing that students with low test scores can
sometimes be the most productive contributors in XLP-enabled learning
process, I realized XLP presents many opportunities for students to
demonstrate their natural talents.\"

Mr. Wang Hong Yu, the General Manager of China\'s Open Course Resource
Center, stated how XLP might affect his business:

\"With shock and awe, I personally witnessed the transformative effect
of a few XLP events on students. I realized that a radical
transformation in education has already taken place here in China. The
traditional textbook-oriented industry could no longer last. We have to
re-position ourselves in the future ecology of education.\" test

Why XLP? Why Now?
=================

XLP did not spring fully formed from a vacuum. There is a specific
**context** surrounding the framework and its development:

Computing Power
---------------

Roughly every 2 years, the number of transistors on a computer chip
doubles[^1]. The resulting increases in computational processing power
strongly synergizes with skyrocketing levels of data storage and falling
costs. This influences every aspect of our lives, and the opportunities
to learn in new and different ways are expanding exponentially.

Big Data
--------

Every second, gigabytes of data are being collected, and no one -- or
even any organization -- will ever be able to access or process it all.
However, learning communities can come together to deal with subsets of
this data and solve real-world problems.

This big data makes what and how humans learn more important. As data
collection and processing increasingly lets machines connect and aid
human decisions (hence creating value), human ingenuity, creativity and
intuition are becoming increasingly important. More and more, the only
things that people should do are the things that only people can do --
and this, of course, places a premium on humans\' ability to learn.

Open Source
-----------

Open source gives anyone the right to use, change, or share a given
technology, thus dramatically reducing the cost of using, copying,
modifying, and redistributing software (and indeed, hardware). This
means anyone can be a creator and build upon the achievements of those
who came before.

Mobile Devices
--------------

Developments in mobile communications and the ubiquity of digital
electronic devices mean that more people can connect to the internet --
and each other -- anytime, anywhere. This means newer, richer
opportunities to learn from and with others, no matter where they are.

Containers and Clouds
---------------------

Big data needs big computing power -- too much for any one institution.
With cloud providers like AliCloud or Amazon Web Services, anyone can
run virtual machines to perform big computing tasks, and with the power
of container platforms (Docker, Kubernetes) they can scale and replicate
with ease.

Globalization
-------------

The problems of today\'s world require diverse communities to offer new
insights. These problems are too big for just one individual or
institution, but affordable Internet access is enabling people all over
the world to collaborate in micro-learning communities to solve these
problems. Learning and working together globally across boundaries of
space and time -- across all boundaries -- is mankind\'s greatest hope
for making progress, and XLP enables this crowd-learning and
collaborative effort to improve the state of the world.

XLP pushes for the emergence of the world as we believe it should be --
egalitarian and equitable, a world in which everyone has a fair chance
to have their voice heard, and a fair opportunity to contribute to the
progress of the world and humanity.

Summary
-------

The above factors both enable and require new modes of learning which
are increasingly collaborative, personalized, self-directed, active,
engaging, and global. XLP has enabled communities of learners to form,
disband, and learn collectively more easily and inexpensively than ever
before. The ubiquitous interconnectedness of data, people, things, and
processes, the opportunities for collaborative crowd-learning -- and new
modes of crowd-learning -- will increase exponentially. These trends
will enable learning to be measured in new ways, and will redefine what
the outcomes of learning should be. XLP capitalizes on these trends and
enables new learning environments and opportunities, while being enabled
and indeed necessitated by them. What humans learn, and the way they
learn, must and will be transformed.

How XLP Works
=============

Missions
--------

XLP\'s core activity is the mission. Participants either prepare the
mission or execute it.

These missions engage individuals and the group as a whole. Each group
designs and operates its own small (or \"micro\") learning community
that serves the individual and collective aims of the creators and
participants.

Each mission is governed by a [logic model](logic_model "wikilink") to
deliver maximum learning value through hands-on activities. In this
chapter we will give a high-level overview of the activities and
participants in an XLP mission and the resources made available to
achieve the mission goals. In the following chapters we will present
detailed step-by-step breakdowns to help you prepare and run missions
yourself.

Participants
------------

XLP engages with learning communities of all shapes and sizes. They may
be:

-   Large or small
-   Physically together, near each other, or spread around the world
-   Of similar (or vastly different) ethnic, cultural, educational,
    professional, and religious backgrounds
-   Similar (or different) skill sets, skill levels, interests, and life
    experiences
-   Relatively homogeneous, or highly diverse
-   Stay together for many years, or come together to design and conduct
    a single learning activity

These micro learning communities come together to learn something
specific, often for a specific duration. Multiple communities can
interact, and may later merge to form larger learning communities, just
as amoebas divide and recombine in different ways. As a community
becomes larger, it becomes more and more like the real world, and
participating individuals, institutions, systems and societies can
iterate upon increasingly optimal solutions.

Each community may have three kinds of members: Mission Designers
(MD\'s), Mission Executors (ME\'s) and Sponsors. The Designers and
Executors learn individually and collectively, and this community is a
microcosm of a larger context -- for example, a university, a society,
or a nation. XLP challenges every learning team to be a focused,
goal-oriented microscopic society in a digital publishing/learning
workflow environment.

### Mission Designer

Mission Designers (MD\'s) design and test learning missions in
accordance with the goals of sponsors, tailored for participants based
on the available resources and requirements.

MD\'s are generally divided into four or five groups that reflect
[Lawrence Lessig\'s Four Forces](#Lessig's_Four_Forces "wikilink") that
are discussed in a later chapter:

-   A law court and perhaps a patent office to regulate the legal
    interactions between ME\'s
-   A media department to reflect the social norms of the ME\'s through
    social media, other digital media, and traditional media
-   Market regulators to regulate the operation of the market
-   Technology support to enable ME\'s to execute missions using the
    technology architecture required to do so

### Mission Executor

Mission Executors (ME\'s) participate in the missions designed by
Mission Designers, and later become Mission Designers themselves. While
on the mission, they learn to execute at a higher level of complexity or
speed, and learn how to guide others to perform the mission.

### Sponsor

School/department that provides resources for XLP program.

Resources
---------

A learning environment encompasses resources in both the virtual and
physical worlds. These can be further divided into two categories:
Resources to prepare before the learning process and resources (which
have been used and tested in the past) to implement during the learning
process:

![](Resources.png "Resources.png"){width="700"}

Outputs
-------

### Containers of Knowledge

Containers are the foundation of XLP. A container can be thought of as a
box that contains software, the data needed to configure that software,
and data created by users (i.e. digital assets). These containers can be
installed and used anywhere, and data can be imported and exported
easily.

-   XLP creates replicable, learning missions in containers, which can
    then be installed and used anywhere in the world
-   Our online platform, Remix, provides the infrastructure to perform
    this digitally
-   Participants create digital assets in their containers using
    [digital publishing](#Digital_publishing "wikilink"), as a record
    and proof of the work they have performed in the mission.

By taking part in the mission and digital publishing workflow,
participants create a body of knowledge covering their area of study.
This is in the form of a container which includes software (typically [
MediaWiki](#Wiki "wikilink") and other tools like
[WordPress](#Blog "wikilink")), configuration, and content produced by
the participants. These containers may contain many forms of digital
asset:

#### Proposal or Report Form

Discusses the conclusion of a certain research study, or the conclusion
of certain industry analysis (\"research study,\" \"business proposal,\"
or \"industry analysis report.\")

#### Budget

Including both a planning schedule (i.e., a resource and human resource
budget and timetable) in addition to a financial budget.

#### Short Movie

Usually a compilation of interesting video footage of the activity,
annotated with written text and non-proprietary music.

#### Prototype Product

A book, pamphlet, brochure, or even physical product.

#### Example Containers

-   [Bauhinia Program](http://47.96.87.30:5111/index.php/Main_Page)

### Team

One of the most important aspects and products of any XLP event is the
friendship developed between participants. Ideally they can create a
social network so they can always tap into these human resources for
future cooperation.

### Refined XLP Manual

Because everyone uses a similar mechanism to learn from each other, we
can collect data on this to improve XLP as a general learning process --
so that everything we do in XLP can be used as case studies or data to
improve practices in future. The most direct contributions will be
sections, refinements or revisions to the XLP operating manual that you
are reading now.

XLP for Mission Designers
=========================

The job of a Mission Designer is to design the mission for Mission
Executors, then deploy it and guide them through it. Typically a Mission
Designer has been an active Mission Executor in the past.

Mission Designers put together:

-   **[Constitution](Constitution "wikilink"):** Defines the goals of
    the mission, and rights and responsibilities of Mission Designers,
    Mission Executors, Sponsors
-   **[Logic Model](Logic_Model "wikilink"):** Defines the context,
    goal, inputs, activities, outputs, effects, and external factors of
    the mission
-   **[Mission Specification](Mission_Specification "wikilink"):**
    Specifies the mission clearly

This process generally takes a month or so, since extensive planning is
required.

It is highly recommended to \"eat your own dogfood\" while preparing the
mission - namely using the XLP methodology itself (logic model,
constitution, etc) to govern the mission design process, with the end
goal of having students produce their own logic models, etc, as outputs
of said mission. For that reason, MD\'s should become familiar with [
how executors execute XLP
missions](#XLP_for_Mission_Executors "wikilink") since designing an XLP
mission is itself an XLP mission.

Kick-Off Meeting
----------------

Sponsors, Mission Designers, and support stuff should come together to
ensure mutual understanding of the XLP mission preparation process. Upon
setting up the [Digital Publishing
Container](#Digital_Publishing_Container "wikilink"), the team can use
tools like [Phabricator](Phabricator "wikilink") to assign tasks and
deadlines.

Digital Publishing Container
----------------------------

Each learning community uses [digital
publishing](digital_publishing "wikilink") tools (like
[MediaWiki](MediaWiki "wikilink")) to publish their activities and
results. These tools are contained in a [Docker](Docker "wikilink")
container which lets users access them online. MD\'s should coordinate
with technical support staff to ensure these containers are deployed and
fully tested, with a regular backup system in place.

Constitution
------------

The [constitution](constitution "wikilink") is a living document that
lays out:

-   Which entities can engage in an XLP mission
-   The purpose of the mission
-   Responsibilities of participants
-   Rights of participants
-   How to change or amend the constitution (typically via
    [git](git "wikilink") or other version control systems)

Mission Designers write their own constitution which \"overlays\" the
[XLP Meta Constitution](XLP_Meta_Constitution "wikilink"). Check an
[example constitution](example_constitution "wikilink") for reference.

This constitution is supplemented by a smart contract. Whereas the
constitution provides the framework, the smart contract handles the
specifics. The constitution is the overarching set of rules,
obligations, privileges and rights for the membership of accounts, while
the smart contract is one defined and created by the parties involved in
a particular digital publishing workflow or creation. That is, every
account is to be governed by both this overarching constitution, and a
smart contract which defines the specifics of one\'s work in the XLP.

XLP for Mission Executors
=========================

Each Mission Executor goes through an extensive orientation program
before engaging in the mission that the Mission Designers created.

Delegations, Groups, and Teams
------------------------------

Depending on the amount of people taking part in activities, they can be
broken down as follows:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](delegation.png "delegation.png"){width="150"}                                                                                             ![](group.png "group.png"){width="150"}                                                                                        ![](teams.png "teams.png"){width="150"}
  A **delegation** may consist of several groups who attend a venue together, but work on different courses with frameworks different to XLP.   A **group** is all the participants working on an XLP course together. They may (or may not) be part of a larger delegation.   Each group is split into **teams**, each working on a specific project that they will be graded on.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orientation Program
-------------------

Usually involves digital identity, agreement reading/signing and quick
overview of how to use digital publishing tools. Participants also gain
experience dealing with many other people on the fly, encountering the
courtroom, participating in market transactions, participating in media
-- i.e. learning how the [four forces](four_forces "wikilink") interact
with XLP activities.

### Digital Identity

Every entity in an XLP mission has a verifiable which they use to:

-   Log in to the digital publishing tools stored in their container
    (like [MediaWiki](MediaWiki "wikilink"),
    [WordPress](WordPress "wikilink"), or
    [NextCloud](NextCloud "wikilink"))
-   Attach ownership to the content they generate
-   Track their learning progress via built-in analytics tools
-   Digitally sign the constitution and smart contracts
-   Securely link their identity to their qualifications and credentials

These participating entities include individuals and organizations, as
well as physical resources and technical services. Digital identities
(like email addresses or [OpenID](OpenID "wikilink")) enable the
tracking of every entity\'s contribution to the crowd-learning process,
and allow participants to sign [Smart
Contracts](Smart_Contracts "wikilink").

### Constitution Reading

Before each XLP mission, each prospective participant reads through the
[constitution](#constitution "wikilink") to learn the mission framework.
This details the rights and responsibilities of each participant in the
activity, in addition to services provided by the sponsor. Participants
digitally sign a Smart Contract (stored on the Blockchain) stating that
they understand the details of the constitution and their
responsibilities, and an agreement stating that they agree to abide by
the overarching constitutional framework during the activity.

### Lab/Knowledge Exploration

\"Taster\" classes allow participants to visit many laboratories and
researchers in a big campus (e.g. Tsinghua University\'s laboratory
exploration program that makes available more than 100 laboratories and
gets participants on campus to see each other\'s research results.) This
gives a broader context of available technology and research results.

Some examples include:

-   The Intelligent Manufacturing Incubator at Zhongguancun
-   The Digital Capability Center at iCenter, Tsinghua University
-   Other local high tech companies
-   Tianhe Super Computing Center
-   Tianjin High Tech Zone

The Mission
-----------

Mission Executors will form teams and create a digital publication, for
example an Industry Analysis Report (IAR), based on field trips,
in-person interviews, and lectures conducted by speakers and tutors.
Ideally, Mission Executors should collect and compile relevant industry
indication data, pictures, and videos taken on field trips or daily
observations during the program, and integrate them into their
publication.

All teams will collaborate on a hosted [ wiki](#Wiki "wikilink") to
write and collate their reports, and then present the finished products
on a visually appealing [ blog](#Blog "wikilink") and as a class
presentation.

-   **Example: Experience China, Industry Frontiers, 2018:**
    [wiki](http://ec.toyhouse.cc/index.php/Main_Page),
    [blog](http://ec.toyhouse.cc:4445/)

Missions usually fall into one of three tracks, each of which use
different tools to create different outputs:

-   **[Industrial frontier](Industrial_frontier "wikilink")**:
    Participants globally search and compile relevant information, and
    creatively tell a compelling story using trustworthy data sources
    and presentation techniques.
-   **[Computational thinking](Computational_thinking "wikilink")**:
    Participants apply optimization technologies and understand the
    principles of optimal limits, and can thus apply optimization to all
    their learning activities.
-   **[Domain Specific](Domain_Specific "wikilink")**: Participants
    learn domain-specific vocabulary and rules, so that they can
    leverage existing bodies of knowledge in an organized manner.

Typically, a mission follows five steps:

Mission Breakdown
-----------------

### Decomposition and Recomposition

Each XLP Mission follows our V Curve:

![V Curve, showing mission decomposition and
recomposition](V_curve2.png "V Curve, showing mission decomposition and recomposition"){width="400"}

Starting from the left of the diagram, participants break down
(decompose) the mission until they get to the most basic (atomic) level,
and then rebuild (recompose) the constituent parts into potential viable
outputs. Breaking it down step-by-step:

1.  Mission specification.
2.  Decomposition of mission specification.
3.  Decompose and repeat steps 1-3 until you reach the atomic level.
    Keep going down, machine checking if you have met the specification.
    Must be at the atomic level.
4.  Go back up once you have defined the most basic decomposition.
5.  Propose a solution of some sort. You can use machines to generate
    new solutions. Frequently test to see if it matches your
    specification.
6.  Pick the best option and [digitally
    publish](#Digital_Publishing "wikilink") it.

A useful analogy is a Lego set:

-   The mission specification would be the picture of the finished model
    on the box
-   The mission would be to build the model
-   The most atomic level is the individual Lego bricks

Participants would look at the picture on the box, decompose it into
component parts until they reach the brick level, then work out the best
way to recompose it (or potentially build something even better) from
there.

### Logic Model

A logic model (also known as a logical framework, theory of change, or
program matrix) is a tool used by funders, managers, and evaluators of
programs to evaluate the effectiveness of a program. They can also be
used during planning and implementation. Logic models are usually a
graphical depiction of the logical relationships between the resources,
activities, outputs and outcomes of a program. While there are many ways
in which logic models can be presented, the underlying purpose of
constructing a logic model is to assess the \"if-then\" (causal)
relationships between the elements of the program.

As part of their digital publication, teams create a one-page logic
model, taking into account activity context, inputs, activities,
effects, external factors, and outcomes.

Each of the boxes below will have precise linguistic properties that can
be examined by human or machine (via Natural Language Processing), to
know if the information in the box fits the specified requirements. In
this way, participants can be assessed and certified automatically,
using Blockchain-witnessed process data collected using the Remix
platform.

![XLP Logic Model](Design_contract.png "XLP Logic Model"){width="500"}

#### 1. Context

-   What\'s your current situation or context?
-   Includes spatial and temporal description (where will you do the
    activity, and when?)

#### 2. Goal

-   What do you want to do?
-   Imperative statement, for example \"conquer Rome,\" or \"land a man
    on the Moon\"

#### 3. Measurable Effects

-   How will you determine success?
-   Set of conditional statements. Output will be measured against these
    to confirm it has achieved desired goal

#### 4. Output

-   What will you deliver?
-   Concrete objects like micro-movies, logic model documents, industry
    analysis reports, financial statements, etc

#### 5. Activities

-   What do you need to do to succeed?
-   Set of partially ordered activities, outlining what happens during
    the project and how to accomplish the project goal

#### 6. Input

-   Resources required to execute the mission, including budget, human
    skills, head counts, etc

#### 7. External Factors

-   What factors that could prevent the team from achieving their goal?

The logic model is one of the first activities each team conducts, which
helps to build a common understanding of the mission as well as the
influencing parameters. During the next steps, continuously referring
back to the logic model helps them check that they are consciously aware
of their own actions.

Using the logic model ensures that every task or project starts with
explicitly-analyzed test cases, originating from Test Driven Design.
Each step of the model feeds into the next step, generally with a
one-to-one relationship. Similar to writing a computer program, the
logic model has two stages of checking/analysis:

-   Static Analysis: A way to read the model itself, and see if the
    content in all boxes is consistent and relevant.
-   Dynamic Analysis: A way to use the \"measurable effects\" to confirm
    output matches expected outcomes, and if task performance fits the
    goal.

Many examples of logic models can be seen from the teams that took part
in [Experience China
2018](http://ec.toyhouse.cc/index.php/Industry_Frontiers_2018).

### Mission Statement

A mission statement acts as a carrier of culture, ethos and
ideology[^2]. Many mission statements are pithy and up-beat, and deal
with abstractions possessing \'a strategic level of generality and
ambiguity\'[^3]

A team\'s mission statement should capture the essence of their goals
and reflect their specific niche. The best mission statements are clear,
concise, and useful (informs. focuses. guides.)[^4]

#### Examples

-   **Public Broadcasting System (PBS)**: To create content that
    educates, informs and inspires.
-   **charity: water**: Bringing clean, safe drinking water to people in
    developing countries.
-   **National Parks Conservation Association**: To protect and enhance
    America's National Park System for present and future generations.
-   **TED**: Spreading Ideas.
-   **Defenders of Wildlife**: The protection of all native animals and
    plants in their natural communities.

Planning and Management
-----------------------

Mission Executors use physical resources like whiteboards, post-its and
note paper, and digital resources like [
Phabricator](#Phabricator "wikilink") to storyboard their mission,
assign tasks, and set a schedule.

![Phabricator](phabricator_workboard.png "Phabricator"){width="600"}

### Scheduling and Task Allocation

Ideally use a whiteboard board, with post-it notes:

![Kan Ban with post-its to organize
tasks](design_contract_activities.jpg "Kan Ban with post-its to organize tasks"){width="500"}

1.  Each team member writes down a list of tasks they think need to be
    done
2.  Team comes together to share their post-its, and come to consensus
3.  Connect post-its with whiteboard markers to mark related ideas
4.  Post-its are put on kanban, arranged by schedule
    (today/tomorrow/this week/later/done)
5.  Each activity is assigned to a team member and recorded on
    Phabricator

### Story-boarding

Teams designing a product or producing a video may find it useful to
produce a storyboard, to visually organize their story or use case.[^5]

![Example
storyboard[^6]](storyboard.jpg "Example storyboard"){width="600"}

### Briefings and Debriefings

At the beginning of each day, the team coordinator should meet with the
team and ensure everyone is up-to-date and clear on their tasks. Some
example questions include:

1.  What thoughts have you had on the project since the end of the last
    working day?
2.  What tasks will you be working on today?
3.  What obstacles do you think may pop up? (and as a team, work out how
    to overcome them)
4.  What other commitments do you have today?

At the end of the day, we suggest a debrief to ensure the team achieved
everything they planned. Some example questions are:

1.  What did you get done today?
2.  What did you plan to do, but didn\'t do? Why not?
3.  What surprises (good or bad) came up? (and as a team, work out how
    to overcome those bad surprises if they happen again)
4.  What\'s your plan for tomorrow?
5.  Any other business?

Activity Coordination
---------------------

Based on the planning done in the previous steps, each team collects
data via interviews with industry experts, site visits, online and
offline research, and surveys. All research must be
[cited](#References "wikilink") and collected on the wiki.

### Surveys

-   Writing good survey questions

### Research

Some helpful links include:

-   [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/)
-   [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/)

Product Development
-------------------

*Note: Not all XLP courses require a product development step, for
example when writing Industry Reports, this step would likely not be
required.*

Mission Executors use tools like [ Jenkins](#Jenkins "wikilink"),
[Modelica](#Modelica "wikilink"), [Jupyter
Notebook](#Jupyter_Notebook "wikilink"), and other prototyping and
integration tools to develop their product, which may be software,
hardware, or a business idea.

![Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.jpg "Jupyter Notebook"){width="600"}

Digital Publishing
------------------

Many of the mission objectives you will be graded on revolve around
digital publishing. Each group participating in the course will have
their own digital container that holds the software and data you will
use and/or create during the course.

When you sign up for the course, you should be given a URL for your
container and a unique login and password. If you haven\'t, please speak
to your coordinator. The software you will use is [
WordPress](#Blog "wikilink") and [ MediaWiki](#Wiki "wikilink")

### Wiki

Mission Executors use the wiki to group edit your report and other
documents.

A wiki is a website on which users collaboratively modify content and
structure directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is
written using a simplified markup language.

![Example wiki, running on
MediaWiki](example_wiki.png "Example wiki, running on MediaWiki"){width="600"}

Wikipedia is by far the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of
the most widely viewed sites of any kind in the world, having been
ranked in the top ten since 2007. There are tens of thousands of other
wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis functioning as
knowledge management resources, notetaking tools, community websites,
and intranets. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection
of articles; as of September 2016, it had over five million articles.

We use [Mediawiki](Mediawiki "wikilink"), the same software that runs
Wikipedia, to allow participants to collaboratively create reports and
other documents.

[A guide to using MediaWiki](#Using_MediaWiki "wikilink") is in the
appendix.

### Blog

After your report is ready, you will use the blog to create pages and
present it in a visually appealing manner.

A blog (short for \"weblog\") is a discussion or informational website
consisting of posts (diary-style updates, displayed newest-first) and
pages (more permanent information).[^7]

![Example blog, running on
WordPress](example_blog.png "Example blog, running on WordPress"){width="600"}

Our blogging software is [WordPress](WordPress "wikilink"): a free and
[open-source](open-source "wikilink") content management system. It is
most associated with blogging, but supports other types of web content
including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries,
and online stores. Used by more than 60 million websites, including
30.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2018, WordPress is the
most popular website management system in the world.[^8]. Our WordPress
installation includes several plugins to make editing easier, most
notably [Elementor](https://elementor.com/).

[A guide to using WordPress and
Elementor](#Using_WordPress_and_Elementor "wikilink") is in the
appendix.

### Presentation

Each team will create a presentation to present the work they\'ve done,
and present to the class. Typically, a presentation should last 5-7
minutes, plus questions and answers afterwards. Don\'t worry about
getting everyone on stage to present - instead limit it to 2-3 speakers.

Since *Microsoft PowerPoint* is the industry standard (and you may not
be presenting from your own computer), we recommend creating your
presentation in *pptx* format. Don\'t use Google Docs or other online
office suites, since connnectivity (due to VPN or lack of network) may
be an issue.

After each team has presented, everyone will regroup and the group will
nominate a team to create one final presentation to summarise the
industry reports of all the teams.

### Poster

Quite often, all of the teams will come together as a group and create
one or more posters that present the work they\'ve done. While other
groups may use markers or a collage to create their poster, we recommend
sticking with the theme of digital publishing and creating it with
software like *Adobe Illustrator*.

Example poster from *Experience China 2018: Industry Frontiers*:

![Example
poster](2400px-Industry_Frontiers_2018_4800px.jpg "Example poster"){width="600"}

Evaluation and Assessment
-------------------------

Using secure technologies like the Blockchain, XLP tracks learner
activity at different levels, assessing how individuals contribute to
their group and how a small group contributes in turn to larger
communities. This allows individuals and teams to receive personalized
feedback and improve over time. This in turn applies to grading and
certification, with both micro-credentials and full degrees stored on
the Blockchain. Access rights can be granted to other universities or
employers to show tamper-proof evidence of achievement.

Remix: The XLP Online Platform
==============================

Think of the world you live in: Imagine the classroom of the future:

In a world that is becoming increasingly digital, it is essential to
teach the skills required to navigate through the digital environment as
early as possible. A gap is opening between those who are
technologically literate and others who are yet to be comfortable with
handling software. The ones who are on the wrong side of this gap will
eventually suffer detrimental implications to their careers and lives.
Such individuals will not be able to take part in collaborative work,
thereby limiting their ability to increase their knowledge. Already,
individuals and institutions lack the tools to create new digital assets
or work with the existing digital information, both of which decrease
their overall potential. Clearly, students need a solution to escape
this situation. Imagine a classroom of the future that is modeled after
the reality outside the classroom. If the reality outside the classroom
is one pervaded by digital tools, so should the classroom. Remix makes
sure this happens. Students will no longer study for exams but prepare
for the challenges that await them in the future. It helps them work and
self-manage teams with tools like Phabricator and Git, while allowing
teachers to track student progress and individual contributions
(captured using a digital data processing system) towards their
respective projects using GitLab. Without such digital tools,
organizational consciousness can\'t be brought to human attention and
organizational learning can\'t happen.

Trustworthy computing technologies such as Blockchain technology are
integrated into Remix. These ensure immutability while ensuring credit
is given where credit is due.

Remix Tools
-----------

The Remix platform offers a large array of powerful tools, manageable by
anyone and scalable to any size.

These tools will be an important asset for any modern educational
institution for which it can fully develop the intellectual potential of
its students and staff. The platform democratizes services that were
previously limited to such an extent that only established companies
were able to utilize their full potential. These services are now
combined into a single platform allowing any individual or institution
to start their digital transformation. Without the need for continuous
online connectivity, the platform can be brought to the farthest corners
of the globe, where a new generation of individuals can start fulfilling
their computational needs. In short, Remix can bring the tools used by
established software companies into any classroom or home enabling
anyone to take part in the future of the digital world.

Together, participants can create new data using tools like Jupyter and
OpenModelica, or analyze and optimize existing information using
Elasticsearch and TensorFlow. Ultimately, every individual can create or
take part in a Digital Publishing Workflow -- a cycle going from Data
Input to Data Management to Data Publishing, all from their own laptop
in one single application. This is Remix.

### What is a Microservice?

The central idea behind microservices is that some types of applications
become easier to build and maintain when they are broken down into
smaller, composable pieces which work together. Each component is
continuously developed and separately maintained, and the application is
then simply the sum of its constituent components. This is in contrast
to a traditional, \"monolithic\" application which is all developed all
in one piece.

Applications built as a set of modular components are easier to
understand, easier to test, and most importantly easier to maintain over
the life of the application. It enables organizations to achieve much
higher agility and be able to vastly improve the time it takes to get
working improvements to production. This approach has proven to be
superior, especially for large enterprise applications which are
developed by teams of geographically and culturally diverse
developers.[^10]

Remix Microservice Overview
---------------------------

![](remix_tools.png "remix_tools.png"){width="80%"}

### Data Input

Data Input describes the different ways through which data may enter the
Remix platform. In the Digital Publishing Workflow, Data Input lies
between Data Publishing and Data Management, as previously published
data can act as input for Data Management.

Generally, data may enter the system from three source types or
combinations of them.

#### Data Creation

Remix comes with microservices from which new data can be created. For
instance, OpenModelica enables users to create simulations of complex
systems. The data produced by these simulations can then be saved for
later use. Another service, Jupyter, allows for coding, solving
equations, and showing their visualizations that can then be shared in
real time among different users. Again, all the data created can be
saved for later use.

#### Online Data

Remix also allows users to source data from the internet such as
databases, wikis, or pictures. Again, different microservices are
available and integrated for this purpose. Data may be accessed directly
from the internet or downloaded first (for instance, to be brought to
regions where internet access is spare or Internet is slow). Kiwix, for
instance, offers the entire Wikipedia, WikiVoyage, TED Talks, and more
for free to download on their website. This data may also be used as
input for Data Creation, subsequently representing a combination of
data.

#### Private Data

Remix enables users to use their own private data as input for Data
Management and Publishing. For this purpose, the platform comes with
microservices such as Nuxeo, which is a digital asset library already
used by institutions, companies, and individuals to manage their digital
assets and NextCloud for file storage in the cloud. Hence, they can tap
into their existing data and use it as input for other microservices to
create new data, again representing a combination. Generally, such
private data may belong to an individual, an institution, or a company
who can scale up their data storage as required without having to scale
the other microservices thanks to the underlying system architecture.

### Data Management

The data management part of Remix utilizes four different tools to
perform a number of tasks. In the Digital Publishing Workflow, Data
Management lies between Data Input and Data Publishing. The purpose of
data management is to load the given information from the different data
inputs, then optimize it so that it becomes searchable and produces the
best results, which in turn can be visually presented to the user. This
is possible through the use of the ELK stack from Elastic, consisting of
Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana, in combination with the machine
learning capabilities of TensorFlow. These tools are combined to allow
users to perform queries on wide array of data that in turn, can be
optimized based on an infinite number of characteristics. The following
section will describe each tool and how they are an integral part of the
of the Remix framework.

#### Logstash: Data extraction, transformation, and loading

Remix consists of a large number of data sources that each produce a
large quantity of data, in many different formats. It is therefore
necessary to have a tool that can extract, transform and load the input
data into the next step of the process. This is where Logstash is used.
Logstash is an open source server-side data processing pipeline based on
the extract, transform, load (ETL) process.

Each step has varying degrees of complexity, that will be explained in
the following sections:

The first job carried out by Logstash is the extraction of data from the
different defined sources. Extraction is conceptually the simplest task
of the whole process but also the most important. Theoretically, data
from multiple source systems will be collected and piped into the system
for it later to be transformed and eventually loaded into the system.
Practically however, extraction can easily become the most complex part
of the process. The process needs to take data from the different
sources, each with their own data organization format and ensure that
the extraction happens correctly so that the data remains uncorrupted.
This is where validation is used. The extraction process uses validation
to confirm whether the data that was extracted has the correct values,
in terms of what was expected. It works by setting up a certain set of
rules and patterns from which all data can be validated. The provided
data must pass the Transform Load validation steps to ensure that the
subsequent steps only receive proper manageable data. If the validation
step fails, then the data is either fully rejected or passed back to the
source system for further analysis to identify improper records, if they
exist.

The data that is extracted then moves on to the data transformation
stage. The purpose of this stage is to prepare all submitted data for
loading into the end target. This is done by applying a series of rules
or functions to ensure that all business and technical needs are met.
Logstash does this by applying up to 40 different filters to all
submitted data. When filtering is completed, the information is
transformed into a common format for easier, accelerated analysis. At
the same time, Logstash identifies named fields to build structure from
previously unstructured data. In the end of the transformation process,
all data in the system will be structured and in a common format that is
easily accepted by subsequent processes.

The last part of the ETL process is the load phase. The load phase takes
the submitted and transformed data and loads it into the end target.
There are certain requirements defined by the system that must be
upheld. This pertains to the frequency of updating extracted data and
which existing information should be overwritten at any given point.
Logstash allows the system to load onto a number of systems, Remix does
however only require that Elasticsearch receives the data.

#### Elasticsearch: Search and Optimize

Search and optimize are two key attributes of any data management
system. It allows a system to filter away all the unwanted data and
prioritize the results based on a number of given attributes. Search and
optimize are not functions that are limited to basic keyword searches,
but can instead be used for a wide variety of possibilities. Everything
from choosing the correct strategy in a game of chess to simulating the
trajectory of a moving vehicle. In all these cases, the function
utilizes the available information from the different data sources in
combination with machine learning intelligence to give the desired
outcome To achieve this Remix uses Elasticsearch and TensorFlow.
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine that
stores data in a searchable manner. All the data that is passed through
Logstash eventually ends up in Elasticsearch. Here it is structured and
analyzed to allow users to search based on their chosen parameters. The
given parameters are in turn used to filter away all the unwanted
results. What remains is a list of results that in one way or another
are linked to the original search criteria. This list is, in turn,
handed to TensorFlow.

TensorFlow is a mathematical library using deep neural networks in order
to analyze data. The system takes in the data that was selected by
Elasticsearch and prioritizes/orders it according to the pre-determined
criteria. This gives the user a selected number of results that should
be suited exactly to their defined needs.

When it comes to searching and optimizing, Remix\'s key difference
compared to other services is that results are purely based on the user.
If a user specifies a certain interest or academic field that they are
studying, then the optimization will be created with that parameter as a
focus point. Thus, opening up focused research where all
advertising-based rankings or unwanted results are removed.

#### Kibana: Data Visualization

In certain scenarios, the outcome of the data management process
doesn\'t come in the form of links or lines of text. In these cases, it
is often required that the data goes through some sort of visualization
in order to turn it into something that is manageable.

This is carried out by Kibana, the last tool in the data management
process. Kibana is a data visualization plugin that works with
Elasticsearch to provide visualization on top of the content that has
been indexed. It takes all the data that the user has asked for and
gives a visualization if it is applicable. Kibana can therefore also be
seen as being part of the data creation aspect of Remix.

### Data Publishing

The final aspect of any standard research project concerns the
publishing of results and conclusions.

For this reason, the final part of the Remix framework is data
publishing. The purpose of this step is to ensure distribution of new
data to a wide audience while guaranteeing rightful credit and ownership
of published research and findings. To do this, the platform uses two
main tools, MediaWiki and Hyperledger, in combination with the machine
learning capabilities of TensorFlow.

MediaWiki is a digital publishing tool created by the Wikimedia
Foundation. It allows information to be published in a structured and
navigation-friendly way. Remix uses MediaWiki to allow institutions or
individuals to create closed or open wiki spaces in which all their
information and research can be published. Each publisher then creates a
distinct name for each new published article or piece of information.
All the information on the given wiki space is then individually
connected using the deep neural network capabilities of TensorFlow, as
mentioned in the previous chapter. TensorFlow analyses each piece of
information and carefully links it together with other related
information. This, in the end, produces a wiki space which is full of
research articles and other information, in combination with existing
Wikipedia data, that is fully connected. Furthermore, connections and
recommendations of articles can be made based on user preferences. In
other words, if a user is studying biology and is doing research on the
flight patterns of butterflies, then Remix will start creating more
links and finding more research articles on that topic specifically. In
that scenario, it might connect the flight patterns of butterflies to
the evolution of airplane wing structures.6

Ultimately, a person can, through Remix, have access to a deeply
interconnected network of research, published articles, and existing
data from the internet.

To ensure all information in the system is untampered with and that
publishers are rightfully credited, Remix uses trustworthy computing
technologies such as Hyperledger. Hyperledger is an open-source
collaborative blockchain technology that ensures transparency and
immutability of all data in the system. This, in turn, ensures that any
information for which there may be a rightful owner is credited as such.
These tools open up a new dimension of the digital publishing process
that allows institutions and individuals to contribute their knowledge
to a greater audience.

### Groupware

Remix provides Phabricator and GitLab as a platform for participants to
collaborate. GitLab is an open-source web-based Git-repository manager
with wiki and issue-tracking features, allowing users to upload and
share code and digital assets, while ensuring no conflicts occur between
versions.

Phabricator is is a suite of web-based software development
collaboration tools, including a code reviewer, repository browser,
change monitoring tool, bug tracker and wiki. Phabricator integrates
with Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. Participants can use it for project
management and coordination within (and among) teams.

### Architecture

The interconnectedness of services in Remix is made possible using the
Docker platform. Docker uses container technologies to allow
microservices and other digital assets can be run in easily-replicable
sandboxes and not interfere with each other. Unlike virtual machines,
containers do not require a guest operating system which makes them more
lightweight, allowing for more or bigger applications running on a
server or single computer.

With Docker container technologies, we can re-define all digital assets
into three main categories: content data, software data, and
configuration data. These categories can be tagged using a hash code
(similar to Git or Blockchain labels) and can be traded by swapping out
\"tokens\" or hash IDs of the asset. This allows participants to easily
install different software services and start using the asset almost
instantly. The end result is that participants and instructors can
better manage learning activities, and use one consistent namespace to
organize all their assets.

![](remix_architecture.png "remix_architecture.png"){width="400"}

Hence, a multitude of containers can easily be combined in a single
application. This can be done through Docker Compose. While Docker
focuses on individual containers, Docker Compose engenders scripting the
installation of multiple containers that work together to create a
bigger application. Microservices in Remix talk to each other to modify
and move data from its creation, to its management, and publishing. At
the same time, since the microservices are still housed in their
respective containers, any service may be added or removed at any time
without damaging other containers.

Remix also enables deployment, monitoring, and scaling microservices
with Kubernetes, a tool specifically designed for this task.
Microservices can then be scaled individually and independently from
each other (thanks to their containerization), specific to the needs of
the user. Matomo (formerly known as Piwik) is an open-source analytics
software package (similar to Google Analytics) for tracking online
visitors, analyzing important information, and track key performance
indicators. Remix uses this software to track usage of the platform by
participants.

Finally, Mesosphere DC/OS acts as the foundation of the system and adds
a layer of abstraction between Kubernetes and Docker and the user\'s
underlying OS. This operating system for datacenters works specifically
well with microservices and takes care of resource allocation and makes
the system fault-tolerant.

In summary, Remix is an platform that is lightweight, modular, and easy
to install, use, and scale, enabling everyone to make use of the
powerful microservices included. The platform achieves this using a
three-part structure with the microservices being the highest layer of
abstraction followed by the combination of Kubernetes and Docker and
completed by the Mesosphere DC/OS.

Education on the Blockchain
---------------------------

The blockchain is a decentralized technology that acts as a digital
ledger for recording transactions between different entities, both human
and machine. Originally devised for the digital currency Bitcoin, the
blockchain is now being used for many other purposes, including in
education. Below is our guide to making education fairer, deeper, and
more accessible to all by using the blockchain.

> "The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic
> transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial
> transactions but virtually everything of value." - Don & Alex
> Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)

### Historical Context

Like many phenomena, over time education has moved from a centralized
cathedral model to a more decentralized bazaar model[^11]:

#### Education 1.0: Traditional Education

![Education 1.0: Centralized
monoliths](education_1.png "Education 1.0: Centralized monoliths"){width="600"}

Traditional education consists of physical university campuses, and
students attending classes on-site. Students do coursework, lab work,
theses and exams, and these are graded by professors, usually at the end
of the semester. In education 1.0, students are generally passive
consumers of education, receiving information from academic staff[^12]:

Because traditional education is based around a physical space and a
limited number of professors, students are limited by number and
location, and financial and academic requirements for entry can be very
high[^13] [^14].

Because assessment is done by humans, fraud and bias can creep in from
both students and faculty. Indeed, A large-scale study in Germany found
that 75% of the university students admitted that they conducted at
least one of seven types of academic misconduct (such as plagiarism or
falsifying data) within the previous six months.[^15] Some examples of
dishonest behavior include:

-   A woman using an impostor to take a college English test[^16]
-   A Japanese medical university manipulating entrance exam scores to
    limit the number of women admitted[^17]
-   Thousands of UK nationals buying fake degrees from "diploma mill" in
    Pakistan[^18]
-   50,000 UK university students were caught cheating in the previous
    three years, amounting to a so-called "plagiarism epidemic"[^19]

##### Summary

In Education 1.0:

-   A student browses universities within physical proximity and signs
    up for a course, typically for several years
-   The student physically goes to classroom and sits in front of
    professor
-   The student writes thesis and sits exam
-   The professor grades the thesis and exam
-   The professor awards a grade to the student

#### Education 2.0: MOOCs

Education 2.0 moved education online, with Massive Open Online Courses,
offered by sites such as [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com),
[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com), and [EdX](http://www.edx.com). These
courses are open to anyone around the world, and students are given
regular feedback on their performance via the system.

![Education 2.0: Networked
monoliths](education_2.png "Education 2.0: Networked monoliths"){width="600"}

Education 2.0 is the age of networked monoliths. Whereas previously
universities offered courses only to their own students, now they offer
courses on MOOC platforms too. However, these MOOC platforms are
themselves centralized monoliths. Students may take courses on one more
MOOC platforms.

Typically students sign up for a MOOC with their existing digital
credentials like a Facebook login or email address. While convenient,
these are not solid proof of identity in the way that a secure digital
identity (like public/private key) would be. At best, some services
offer biometric identity via webcam.[^20]

Interaction between students (if there is any at all, which is not
often[^21]) is via the MOOC's forum, and is typically centred around
problem-solving and support, rather than content creation, project-based
learning and digital publishing. After the course is finished students
disband (again, if they ever banded together) and go their separate
ways. This limits the possibility for collaboration and groupwork.

Courses are typically assessed by algorithm \[citation needed\], from
students answering multi-choice questions or writing a program that
generates a specific output. This limits many MOOCs in terms of
flexibility and creativity.

##### Summary

In Education 2.0:

-   Student signs up for a course on Coursera, EdX or another platform
    offering educational courses, typically for a few weeks or months
-   Student works from wherever they are in the world
-   Student coursework is graded by the MOOC system and assessors
    working for the MOOC
-   MOOC system awards grade to student

But how do we ensure the student is actually the one doing the work?

Physically decentralized but central MOOC system

### The Future: Education 3.0: Education on the Chain

With Education 3.0 we can modularize, granularize, democratize and
decentralize education further:

-   The line between educator and student gets blurred, as anyone can
    directly offer courses or tutoring and get paid for it
-   Students can learn from anywhere in the world, from a single lesson
    to a series of courses
-   Students and educators can monetize the materials they create,
    instead of them languishing on a hard disk
-   Educators can spend less time grading and more time doing valuable
    tasks
-   Qualifications can be verified and trusted

![Education 3.0: Mass P2P
learning](education_3.png "Education 3.0: Mass P2P learning"){width="600"}

We do this by leveraging the power of the blockchain, specifically
Ethereum.

Ethereum is a blockchain that enables anyone to create decentralized
applications and smart contracts.[^22] A smart contract is a legal
contract in the form a computer program stored that enables secure,
verified transactions between two or more entities.[^23] This program is
encoded on the Ethereum blockchain, and typically takes cryptocurrency
as input. Parties sign the contract using their [digital
identity](digital_identity "wikilink"), typically in the form of a PGP
private/public key pair.

We aim to create two kinds of token to make this possible. We are still
working out some details, but for now:

-   A cryptocurrency called **EducationCoin**, an ERC20 token. Educators
    can offer courses using this token, and students can purchase
    courses. It can also be used to purchase student-created digital
    assets ( e.g. market reports, white papers) on a decentralized
    marketplace.
-   Integrating currency too deeply into education is ethically dicey.
    For interactions on a student-student marketplace we may need a
    closed loop non-currency cryptotoken. For now let's call this
    **EducationToken**.

#### Choosing a Course

The blockchain allows us to decentralize the MOOC concept further and
allows decentralized marketplaces for courses, enabling content creators
to offer their own curriculum, and giving users confidence with a
built-in rating system. Students from anywhere in the world can browse
this marketplace and elect to take a course by signing a smart contract.

Since anyone can be a course provider in education 3.0, the line between
educators and students blurs considerably. Anyone can offer their
materials and assistance (via one-on-one or one-to-many personalized
tuition) on this platform. Participants browse the offerings, find the
course that best suits them and pay via EducationCoins. They can
purchase the whole course, just certain units, or specific guidance from
the course creator.

Because there is less human effort required in assessments, smaller
machine-graded courses can easily be offered. These
"micro-qualifications" cover specific niche skills or disciplines, for
example the React Javascript framework.[^24]

#### Course Signup

During course signup, students read through the course
[\#constitution](#constitution "wikilink"), which outlines their rights
and responsibilities. This is both a human-readable document and
embodied digitally in the form of a smart contract. Students sign this
smart contract with their digital identity to show they have read their
rights and responsibilities during the course.

#### Coursework

Depending on the type of course, different types of coursework may be
done:

##### Individual Learning

May consist of watching videos, answering multi-choice questions, and
writing code that creates a specific output. Similar to many programming
courses in MOOCs. Students can offer support to each other via the
platform's forum and social features, and the best forum answers get
paid in EducationCoins. This incentivizes students to contribute quality
answers and build community.

##### Group Learning

More project-based. Students do coursework on digital publishing
platforms like MediaWiki and WordPress, which they sign into using their
digital identity, ensuring any data they create is tied to them. These
services have open APIs, so their data can be extracted and stored on a
blockchain (either private or the main chain) to ensure data
integrity.[^25] Courses can be gamified with cryptocurrency tokens as
incentives, and an internal marketplace can be set up for students to
trade skills and knowledge with EducationCoins.

##### Crowd Learning

Any student can create a portfolio on a global student expertise
exchange platform (similar in concept to Upwork) and seek out other
students around the world who need their skills. This creates a
marketplace for students to share knowledge and expertise, and enables
large-scale crowd learning. This expertise can be "paid" for using
EducationTokens, a non-currency cryptotoken.

Many students can cooperate to create a single digital asset, on which
they will be jointly assessed, and they can then sell this asset (or
subsections of it) on a decentralized digital asset marketplace.

#### Assessment

For assessment, student-created data is gathered and stored on the
blockchain to prevent tampering. It is then sorted using tools like the
[Elastic Stack](Elastic_Stack "wikilink"), then processed, checked for
plagiarism, and assessed by machine learning (with tools like
[TensorFlow](TensorFlow "wikilink")). It can then be aggregated, ranked,
and visualized for professors to perform their own assessments if
required.

Students can be awarded EducationCoins for quality work.

#### Grading and Qualification

As part of the assessment, a student's qualification will be signed by
the institution (for example, Tsinghua University) and stored securely
on the main blockchain, allowing access by employers, institutions and
anyone else to whom the student grants access via app or other means.

By tying every step of the course to a student's verifiable digital
identity and assessing by machine instead of humans, we greatly reduce
fraud, bias, and human error in the system, and can scale education to
deal with thousands of learners. Qualifications can be verified and
trusted by students, universities, and employers.

![Assessing and grading
students](blockchain-assess-grade.png "Assessing and grading students"){width="600"}

Access to these qualifications can be encoded as a QR code which could
be embedded in a badge via the [OpenBadge](https://openbadges.org/)
standard (similar to Scout badges, but digital). A set of skills can
form a portfolio accessible via the web or dedicated app. As we
transition to a model of lifelong learning, we can foresee people
earning these badges throughout their life, and perhaps professional or
job-hunting networks (like LinkedIn or Monster.com) may one day have a
function to search by badge to find the best candidates.[^26]

![Example digital
badges](badges.png "Example digital badges"){width="600"}

#### Monetizing Coursework

In Education 1.0, students' output was left to languish in filing
cabinets or hard disks. In Education 2.0, it's stored on a hard disk or
in the cloud. Even for professors, they have to pay publishers like
[Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com) to publish their content.[^27] In
Education 3.0, we aim to flip that model and let anyone publish and
monetize their academic content.

Coursework performed by students (for example, white papers, essays,
industry analysis reports) can be exported and stored on the blockchain
via IPFS[^28] then offered to buyers or licensees via a decentralized
content marketplace (like [Steemit](https://steemit.com/).)

\[diagram\]

1.  Create and export content
2.  Upload content to IPFS
3.  Choose license
4.  Set fees
5.  Publish

Buyers sign a smart contract outlining their rights to use the content
(for example, they may be free to re-use the content but not to edit
it), and payment is made to the student(s) via cryptocurrency. Since the
marketplace is decentralized, there is no middleman to take a cut and
creators receive payment in full. In addition, these student-created
digital assets can be broken down into their constituent parts, so if a
buyer only wants a specific diagram and not the whole text they can just
license that.

\[diagram\]

1.  Browse content based on keyword or publication number
2.  Choose how you want to use content (use full content, use partial
    content, pay per use, pay per impression, flat-rate fee)
3.  Sign smart contract
4.  Pay content creator
5.  Download content

![Monetizing students' digital
assets](blockchain-monetize-asset.png "Monetizing students’ digital assets"){width="600"}

In group-created works, a record of who created what can be kept on the
blockchain, so payment can be shared equitably between creators.

#### Marketplaces

We have discussed four different marketplaces above:

##### Education Market

Creators provide courses, resources, tutoring, and expertise for
learners. Learners can create coursework using built-in digital
publishing tools, and this can be assessed (at least partially) by
algorithm.

-   Example products: Astronomy 101; Psychology 305;
-   Target customers: Students, learners
-   Target providers: Educators

##### Digital Asset Market

A marketplace for white papers, market reports, theses, academic papers,
etc. Like a decentralized Elsevier.

-   Example products: White paper on social media trends in China;
    photographs, data, and maps of soil erosion around London
-   Target customers: Business, academia
-   Target providers: Students, professors, educators

Traditional competitors would be journal companies like Elsevier, who
charge both for publishing and for access

##### Talent Market

Learners can post their profiles and qualifications here for recruiters
to see

-   Example "products": Student with 4-year degree in computer science;
    Student with nano-degree in writing smart contracts
-   Target customers: Recruiters
-   Target providers: Qualified learners

##### Learner Market

An internal marketplace for learners to trade expertise, knowledge, and
assistance. However, since the line between creators and learners is
blurred, do we need this?

-   Target customers: Learners
-   Target providers: Leaners, creators

#### User Experience

##### The EducationCoin App

Initially, the EducationCoin app will focus on providing a high-quality
marketplace experience for learners (i.e. consumers, not creators),
including:

![App mockups](educoin_app.png "App mockups"){width="600"}

-   Sign up for account
-   Purchase EducationCoins
-   Browse courses
-   Sign up as student for a course
-   Make payment for course in EducationCoins
-   Taking (simpler) courses

More complex courses (which need extensive coursework and writing) are
less suitable for a smartphone experience and can be performed on the
EducationCoin web platform.

##### The EducationCoin Web Platform

The web platform provides a more comprehensive set of services:

**Creators can:**

-   Create their courses and set prices
-   Upload materials for their courses
-   Send alerts to students of their courses

**Learners can:**

-   Sign up for courses
-   Use hosted MediaWiki/WordPress to do more complex coursework
-   Contact creators and other learners to solicit advice or cooperate
    together
-   Set bounties for questions to be answered or expertise given

### Summary

EducationCoin and EducationToken enable:

-   **Fairer distribution of wealth** to both students and educators
-   **Large scale crowd-learning** through a student skill marketplace
-   **Democratised access** for educators and students around the world
-   **Bias-free, fraud-free assessment** of all student work
-   **Exposure to recruiters** through verified qualifications and
    talent marketplace

**Note: Below table is still a draft. Needs lots of work**

### Technical Analysis

#### Infrastructure

Education 3.0 is primarily digital - since everything boils down to
zero's and one's, automation and computation can be applied to create
efficient, verifiable workflows.

##### Software Stack

At present all of the software stack we have used in XLP has been
traditional server-based microservices. Decentralized Apps (DApps) are
still some way off when it comes to capabilities.

-   Digital media creation tools like MediaWiki, WordPress, Jupyter
    Notebook, etc
-   Tools to extract, analyse and write that data to blockchain:
    Logstash, Elastic Search, TensorFlow
-   Tools to visualize that data for human assessment (if required):
    Kibana
-   A front-end to tie all of this together

#### Smart Contracts in Depth

We use smart contracts throughout the whole process outlined above:

-   Educators putting their courses on the course marketplace
-   Students electing to take courses
-   Educators assigning grades to students
-   Licensees buying access to student-created data

In addition, we use digital signatures to prove ownership and work on
certain assets:

-   Courses created by educators
-   Coursework done by students
-   Qualifications, signed by both student and educator

##### Signing a Smart Contract

The first contract signed by students is the constitution, which
outlines their rights and responsibilities. To do this they need to set
up a digital identity, typically a public/private key pair using the PGP
standard:

OpenPGP is the most widely used encryption standard in the world. It is
based on PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) as originally developed by Phil
Zimmermann. The OpenPGP protocol defines standard formats for encrypted
messages, signatures, and certificates for exchanging public keys. PGP &
GPG is an easy-to read, informal tutorial for implementing electronic
privacy on the cheap using the standard tools of the email privacy field
- commercial PGP and non-commercial GnuPG (GPG)[^29]

PGP uses two keys for encryption - a private key to encrypt messages,
and a public key to decrypt them. Bruce Schneier writes[^30]:

> "Putting mail in the mailbox is analogous to encrypting with the
> public key; anyone can do it. Just open the slot and drop it in.
> Getting mail out of a mailbox is analogous to decrypting with the
> private key. Generally it's hard; you need welding torches. However,
> if you have the secret (the physical key to the mailbox), it's easy to
> get mail out of a mailbox."

A file encrypted with PGP typically looks like this:

    -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

    -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

In the context of email:

-   Alice and Bob agree on a public key algorithm.
-   Bob sends Alice his public key.
-   Alice encrypts her message with Bob's public key and sends it to
    Bob.
-   Bob decrypts Alice's message with his private key.

##### Writing a Smart Contract

Smart Contracts are often written in the Solidity programming language,
although LLL and Serpent are also available. They are then run on the
Ethereum Virtual Machine, which implements a full stack Turing-complete
computer on the blockchain.

XLP Philosophy
==============

Micro, Meso, Macro
------------------

The XLP curriculum has three tiers:

### Macroscopic in Nature

![](Macro.png "Macro.png"){width="400"}

Globally search and compile relevant information, and creatively tell a
compelling story using trustworthy data sources and presentation
techniques.

### Mesoscopic in Sorting Order

![](Meso.png "Meso.png"){width="400"}

Apply optimization technologies and understand the principles of optimal
limits, so that participants and teams can apply optimization to all
their learning activities.

### Microscopic in Contexts

![](Micro.png "Micro.png"){width="400"}

Guide participants to be acquainted with domain-specific vocabulary and
rules, so that they can leverage existing bodies of knowledge in an
organized manner.

The three categories of courses are built on top of our Remix platform,
which provides a foundation of industry-standard tools to help XLP
participants achieve the goals of their curriculum.

![](Dpw_os.png "Dpw_os.png"){width="400"}

The MD\'s and ME\'s learn individually and collectively. The community
of sponsors, MD\'s, and ME\'s is a microcosm of a larger context -- for
example, a university, a society, or a nation. XLP challenges every
learning team to be a focused, goal-oriented microscopic society in a
digital publishing/learning workflow environment.

![](dpw_plus_participants.png "dpw_plus_participants.png"){width="400"}

Theory U
--------

Theory U is a change management method created by Otto Scharmer, who has
worked with Tsinghua University and Xu Lili (Theory U\'s China
Coordinator) to refine XLP. The principles of Theory U are suggested to
help political leaders, civil servants, and managers break through past
unproductive patterns of behavior that prevent them from empathizing
with their clients\' perspectives and often lock them into ineffective
patterns of decision making.

Several of XLP\'s steps correlate with Theory U:

![](Theory_u.png "Theory_u.png"){width="400"}

By following these principles, we can achieve several beneficial
outcomes:

### Early Success

Provides resources and knowledge that enables participants to kick off
their learning journey with excitement.

### Fail Early, Fail Safe

Ensures participant learning assignments are challenging enough, so they
can observe their shortcomings and correct their course of actions in
the early stage of the mission.

### Convergence

Guide participants to re-combine their team structures to create a
synergistic product/service with other teams.

### Demonstration

Every learning program should end with a ceremonial event that allows
participants to summarize their learning experience and present it to
other people who may be future XLP participants.

Lessig\'s Four Forces
---------------------

Lawrence Lessig\'s Code Version 2.0 states that a number of forces
regulate the behavior of individuals in a society or community:

![](four_forces.png "four_forces.png"){width="400"}

### Law: The Rules a Community Recognizes

-   Imposes constraints on the behavior of members by explicitly
    threatening punishment or sanctions that the community as an entity
    will enforce.

### Social Norms: How a Community Expects You to Behave

-   Similar to the law in that norms constrain behavior of community
    members
-   Unlike the law, community members impose social norms on each other
    informally
-   Whereas the law, and (prospective) punishment for breaking the law,
    is explicit, social norms are understood by all, or most, of the
    community without being explicitly stated or mandated.

### Market: How Much Do You Pay?

-   Enables buyers and sellers of goods, services, information, labor,
    and capital to exchange.
-   The market forces of supply and demand determine the equilibrium
    level of prices in each respect market.
-   Implicitly regulates behaviour of community members, for prices can
    fluctuate rapidly dependent on consistency and reputation.

### Architecture: The Way the World Is

\"The way the world is, or the ways specific aspects of it are.\"

-   The way a product (not a service) has been designed, created,
    manufactured, or built.
-   Regulates community members by imposing physical or
    technical/technological constraints.
-   Special due to \"agency\" - does not require direct human
    intervention to operate (whereas other forces require police force,
    community members, merchants, etc), so it is \"self-executing.\"

While each of these regulating forces is separate and distinct, all four
influence each other as they regulate the behavior of community members.

### Example: Smoking

In Code version 2.0, Lessig uses the regulation of smoking to illustrate
the operation and interdependence of these four forces. If you want to
smoke, Lessig asks, what constraints do you face?

#### Law

Federal, state, and local laws laws regulate:

-   Minimum age and ID requirements
-   Where you are permitted to smoke
-   Tax on the purchase of cigarettes (aiming to reduce smoking
    incidence)

#### Social Norms

Social norms can constrain behavior even more than laws:

-   Smoking in the house of a non-smoking friend
-   Smoking near children in restaurants

#### Market

-   The higher the price of cigarettes, the more financially constrained
    you are by smoking
-   Higher insurance premiums for smokers reduces the desire to smoke

#### Architecture

The way cigarettes are designed and manufactured.:

-   Filterless cigarettes are more dangerous, so more pressure to reduce
    smoking. Ultralights may tempt you to smoke more (thus costing more
    in terms of money and social norms)

### How do the Four Forces Interact?

The four forces are interdependent; they interact, and influence each
other as they regulate the behavior of individuals in the community. A
change in one may influence another. Using the example of smoking:

#### Social norms → Market

![](social_norms_market.png "social_norms_market.png"){width="700"}

#### Market → Law/Social norms

![](market_law_social_norms.png "market_law_social_norms.png"){width="700"}

### How do the Four Forces Relate to XLP?

Since XLP is a methodology for crowd-learning, these four forces also
(by definition) regulate the behavior of individuals in each
micro-learning community, and ultimately increasingly large macro
learning communities.

#### Law

The law is constituted by XLP\'s digital recording infrastructure (legal
evidence collection mechanism), which allows the filing of complaints,
patent filing, and law enforcement.

#### Social Norms

One of the most important forces shaping social norms in XLP is the idea
that all learning outcomes must be demonstrable. One of the most
important end products is publishing the crowd-learning results online
using a digital publishing system.

#### Market

XLP\'s transaction validation system records and validates transactions
executed in the crowd-learning environment.

#### Architecture

XLP\'s technology architecture is one of the most important forces that
regulate the behavior of individuals in our crowd-learning environment.
Architecture is the only one of the four forces that, once created or
enabled, does not require direct human intervention to operate. It
functions alone and directly; that is, it is \"self-executing.\"

The architecture in XLP\'s crowd-learning environment is the Remix
Platform, a combination of hardware and software. A later section in
this manual will describe it in detail.

### The Four Forces, XLP, and The Real World

A noteworthy feature of XLP is how each force within a specific micro-
or macro-learning community interacts with the same force in the \"real
world.\" For example, much of XLP\'s legal framework interacts with that
of the real world: It is difficult to divorce the two, given that the
real world\'s legal frameworks and mechanisms have evolved over
centuries, and to regulate the individuals in a community. Patents filed
in the XLP crowd-learning environment may very well also be filed in the
real world, for example. If XLP is internationally and legally
recognised, then this process of duplication may become automatic.

Similarly, given that one of the most important end products of an XLP
activity is publishing the crowd-learning results, it is natural that
these results are published via a real-world means like social media,
other online media, or traditional media that is accepted by social
norms.

In the market, a product or service might attract investment in the XLP
environment -- and might attract real-world investment too. Intellectual
property in XLP\'s environment might also be bought and sold in the real
world.

Finally, XLP\'s architecture has its roots in the public commons of
universities, and specifically physical campuses and other resources
that enable the crowd-learning environment to emulate the the real world
to a large degree. This is an important factor in XLP enabling learning
on a large and public scale.

Technical Analysis
==================

Containerization
----------------

Containers are the foundation of XLP, the Remix platform, and XLP\'s
Digital Publishing Workflow:

-   XLP creates replicable, containerized learning missions, which can
    then be deployed and scaled up anywhere in the world
-   Remix provides the infrastructure to perform this digitally - i.e.
    Docker and Kubernetes
-   participants create containerized digital assets using XLP\'s
    [Digital Publishing
    Workflow](Digital_Publishing_Workflow "wikilink"), as a record and
    proof of the work they have performed in the mission.

### Docker Containers

Docker is an operating system abstraction layer, providing an
abstraction boundary which manages collective boundaries and experience
for its users. A Docker container **\'contains**\':

-   An operating system (often Linux/Windows/MacOS)
-   The programs you want to run on the operating system (for example,
    WordPress/Mediawiki)
-   The application and configuration data for the program (for example,
    WordPress media assets, WordPress configuration details)
-   The data for the program (if WordPress, a database of MySql/Mariadb)

This container and its data(volume) can be save/exported from the Docker
filesystem and be loaded, for easy deployment anywhere.

Like an operating system, Docker:

-   Authenticates the container via its hash
-   Schedules priorities, for example what resources the container has
    access to
-   Manages input and output, for example how many of the host
    machine\'s resources it may use.

### What do We Run in Docker?

![](Container_types.png "Container_types.png"){width="700"}

### Namespaces

Computers operate on levels of abstraction. Otherwise we would be
dealing directly with ones and zero\'s. A common kind of abstraction is
a namespace, which organizes and names objects. Some examples include:

-   Memory registers: Each register has it\'s own unique address
-   Filenames: Each file on a system has it\'s own unique path and
    filename combination
-   URLs: Each website is reached via different URL

Containers also have their own unique namespace, namely their 256-bit
hash. An example hash (shown in hexadecimal format) would be:

    7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65dfc2d4b1fa3d677284addd200126d9069

This hash acts as a digital fingerprint, and is highly secure since
there are 256^32^ combinations which would take 3x10^51^ years to crack
if using fifty supercomputers.

### Verification and Security

With filenames or URLs, you have no guarantee you\'ll actually get what
you think you\'ll get. Today \*google.com\* might take you to a search
engine. Tomorrow Google may get hacked and you could end up on a site
that \*looks\* like Google but steals your login credentials.

Containers are different. Since Docker hashes are unique and
unforgeable, we can verify a Docker container and add it to a database
of other verified containers. When you\'re then deploying that
container, you can check that hash matches the hash in our database,
thus ensuring the container will run consistently. This can be thought
of as similar to the police comparing fingerprints of known criminals
with fingerprints at a crime scene.

Secure Concurrent Editing
-------------------------

A potential barrier with generating big data simultaneously across a
distributed network is the [Byzantine Generals
Problem](Byzantine_Generals_Problem "wikilink")5: Reliable computer
systems must handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting
information to different parts of the system.

In an abstract sense, this can be expressed as a group of generals
camped with their troops around an enemy city. They can only communicate
by messenger to agree on a common battle plan. However, one or more of
them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. So, how can we
find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach
agreement?

It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if
and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single
traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written
messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and
possible traitors.

In XLP, the problem can be seen as failing to process large amounts of
data at the same time. The solution is a distributed repository (like
[Git](Git "wikilink")) allowing all participants to transparently see
what content others contribute. This increases everyone\'s confidence in
the trustworthiness of their fellow participants, thus making them more
likely to contribute and share content, and that this content will be
compiled into a consistent result.

XLP uses existing computing science techniques that improve the ability
to process the concurrent publishing of massive amounts of distributed
intellectual content. Bitcoin also ensures Byzantine fault tolerance --
in other words, solves the Byzantine Generals Problem -- by
incorporating a distributed database that lets any participant view the
entire history of transaction records. This enables the processing and
compiling of massive amounts of intellectual resources on an Internet
scale. Open-source version control software, like Git, Concurrent
Versions System (CVS), and Apache Subversion (SVN), also enable sharing
of human-contributed content -- be it source code, novels, textual
content, movies, or photographs -- and enable the processing and
compiling of data on a massive scale.

Decentralization
----------------

By using computer-generated smart contracts stored on technologies
similar to Blockchain, organizations that practice XLP can run as a
decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This means that participant
performance can be assessed algorithmically and stored securely on their
lifelong digital learning profile. Using Blockchain ensures XLP abides
by the principles of Trustworthy Computing, giving participants,
organizations, and employers faith in the quality of work.

Tokenization
------------

Tokenization goes hand in hand with the theory of containerization. Any
kind of digital information can be seen as a data container, and every
container can be broken down into smaller containers. For example, this
XLP manual is a container, which contains the necessary information for
executing XLP. The XLP manual container consists of sub-containers - one
of them is this section.

Modern Blockchain (Distributed Ledger) technology can be used as a
common representation of any type of container. A token is simply all
bundled information for uniquely representing a container on a
distributed ledger. This token uniquely identifies a distinct container
and guarantees its authenticity. tokens can be used as a proof of
authorship, as well as ownership and hence used for trading and sharing
containers.

This section will present the most important history and technical
concepts which enable tokenization. Then, distributed ledger technology
is discussed. Lastly, the necessary architecture for the
XLP-Token-System (XTS) is derived and presented.

### Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain)

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto the paper \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic
Cash System\" [^31]. In his work he describes a global decentralized
system for exchanging tokens. The inherent tokens digitally represent a
monetary value and are labeled as Bitcoins.

This system, called a Blockchain or Distributed Ledger (DL) can be
created by combining available technologies and algorithms such as:

-   Public-private-key cryptography
-   Digital signatures
-   Digital timestamps
-   Peer-to-peer protocols
-   Cryptographic hashes
-   Merkle trees

Additionally, a DL system needs a consensus algorithm for reaching
agreement between the distributed participants. Such a consensus
algorithm ensures that there is a global world state of values, on which
the majority of participants agree. In Bitcoin, this system is called
Proof-of-Work and relies on participants using their computing power for
solving a randomized \"riddle\".

Four Forces
-----------

XLP activities are executed in a highly technical context, which takes
into account the Four Forces discussed previously. These forces require:

### Legal Mechanisms

A dispute resolution process and patent filing process.

### Market Mechanisms

Exchange of goods, services, information, and capital, and establishing
prices for these through supply/demand dynamics. Technical Architecture

Sophisticated technological infrastructure that allows transdisciplinary
learning across space and time.

### Social Norms

Agreed-upon standards for what constitutes acceptable behavior --
covered in orientation and general university practices.

Participants need access to technology that enables the four forces to
regulate behavior, and, just as importantly, must learn its use before
the XLP activity.

Through their digital identity, participants must be trained to (among
other things):

-   File patents
-   File complaints and sue other entities
-   Defend their legal rights
-   Buy and sell intellectual property and financial and other
    commodities
-   Publish the products of their learning and their learning outcomes
    via social (or other) media

The four forces are all present to an extent in traditional modes of
learning, but their respective and collective functions in
crowd-learning is relatively minimal, and not systematic. A major reason
is the lack of a common digital infrastructure to track market
transactions, patent applications, and refutation processes; nor has
social media been systematically used to identify and measure cultural
norms in a classroom and how they relate to a specific learning
scenario.

Therefore, XLP\'s activity context is highly technical, and requires big
data and other sophisticated technologies and principles to collect,
store, process, and analyze data.

From a technical perspective, XLP is:

-   A crowd-learning distributed operating system that collects, stores,
    processes, and analyzes data and generates condensed and refined
    content with machine and human help.
-   A learning ecology that combines organic entities with digital
    equipment and processes. XLP leverages open-source technologies,
    distributed version control systems, and cryptocurrencies to track
    learners\' individual and collective contributions to the
    collaborative, collective learning process and learning outcomes.

Computer cycles for collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing data
are clearly different from human cycles. Thus enabling many people to
simultaneously revise content, for example, requires sophisticated
engineering management practices and workflow management techniques,
which we generally don\'t find in traditional educational settings.
However, this technology is becoming increasingly mature and is being
leveraged by XLP to become a distributed crowdlearning operating system
that provides a learning context -- both for individuals and for the
crowd -- that is very different from that of a traditional educational
setting.

XLP Constitution
----------------

### Preface: A New Kind of Constitution

Typically, constitutions are decomposed into the following mutually
exclusive elements:[^32]

1.  Membership
2.  Purpose
3.  Responsibilities
4.  Rights
5.  How to change or dissolve the constitution

The subsequent shape of the constitution will be outlined by the
specifics of the boundaries of the above elements. Take the US
constitution. The above elements are set as:

1.  US Citizens, and eligibility for membership of Congress
2.  To delineate the national frame of government
3.  Of the Congress, Vice-President and President
4.  Seen in a separate document, the US Bill of Rights, and in the
    Amendments to the Constitution
5.  Proposed by Congress and ratified by the unanimous vote of all
    thirteen state legislatures

For a different purpose, for instance, defining the practices of a firm,
the constitution may have the following boundaries of the above
elements:

1.  All full and part-time employees of the firm
2.  To clearly define and govern the workflow, rights and
    responsibilities of all members within the firm, serving as a useful
    reference point in the case of any disputes
3.  To be punctual, treat others with respect, follow the order of
    command, and complete allocated work
4.  Equal opportunities; rights of life, liberty and property; freedom
    from bullying or physical intimidation
5.  A supermajority (of two-thirds of the total membership of the firm)
    at any meeting where 90% of total membership of the firm is
    physically present

The boundaries set by the XLP constitution, however, are of a different
sort entirely. Let this be defined by the following boundaries:

1.  Accounts: any member who holds the correct login credentials
2.  To clearly articulate the rights, privileges and responsibilities of
    all accounts in the XLP. Useful to define the boundaries of
    practice, and to easily resolve any potential disputes
3.  To be a fully-functional and productive member of the XLP and the
    Digital Publishing Workflow, rather as a Mission Designer, Mission
    Executor, or both
4.  Of life, liberty and property of all accounts of the XLP; equal
    opportunities; freedom from intimidation, bullying, or harassment of
    any kind
5.  A supermajority of 80% of all accounts where at any gathering where
    at least 75% of the total membership is virtually present

Where these examples differ is in the boundaries. Although membership is
explicitly defined and referred to only in one section, all five
sections are in relation to an agent of some kind. The first two are in
relation to human beings, the third is in relation to accounts.

An account, as defined above, is a digital entity. This digital entity
can belong to a human (such as human's banking account) or a machine.
What this constitution sets to clearly articulate is that the boundaries
of membership lie not at the individual *human* but at the individual
*account*. Since accounts can belong to both humans and machines, this
constitution is unique in its kind in two distinct ways:

1.  It provides rights, privileges and responsibilities to *machines*
2.  It treats machines and humans on an *equal* footing

This constitution makes no claim on the relative consciousness of
machines or any non-human entity, it merely permits for its possibility.
By treating all accounts as homogenous and identical, it gives all
accounts a unique identity that is on equal relation to all other
accounts. This process also allows for complete anonymity. By proving
all accounts with the same rights, there exists no agent who can
decipher whether an account belongs to a human or machine at first
glance. This constitution, therefore, may go some way to passing the
Turing Test. There will exist no unique feature belonging to any account
that makes it below or above this constitution. This constitution abides
by the rule of law:

> '\[W\]ith us no man is above the law \[and\] every man, whatever be
> his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and
> amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals.' Dicey, A.V.,
> 1982 \[1885\], Introduction to the Study of the Law of the
> Constitution, London: McMillan and Co.

This constitution, therefore, sets out the rights of accounts
explicitly. It sets out the relations between accounts, the privileges
and responsibilities of accounts with other accounts, what they owe for
each other, and what they are guaranteed against each other. Whether a
right of a human or machine account is irrelevant in determining the
unlawfulness of an act, what is significant is that it was the jeopardy
of the right in question was in relation to an account.

This constitution will be supplemented by a [smart
contract](smart_contract "wikilink"). The constitution provides the
framework, whereas the smart contract handles the specifics. The
constitution is the overarching set of rules, obligations, privileges
and rights for the membership of accounts, the smart contract is one
defined and created by the parties involved in a particular digital
publishing workflow or creation. That is, every account is to be
governed by both this overarching constitution, and a smart contract
which defines the specifics of one's work in the XLP.

![](constitution_smart_contract.png "constitution_smart_contract.png"){width="504"
height="208"}

This constitution sets out the relations within and between teams. Each
team comprises of Mission Designers and Mission Executers attempting to
carry out their own publication within the digital publishing workflow.
In addition to each member's role as a Mission Designer or Executer,
each member will have a role in the team. These roles are Officer
(president), Treasurer (chancellor), Secretary (administrator) and
Contributor (Team member). Between teams, there is a continuous red
thread, representing the continuous communication and interconnectedness
between Teams. Throughout, each team's Officers, Treasurers, and
Secretaries will communicate to compare progress and ensure the smooth
running of the XLP. Mission Designers and Mission Executers, moreover,
will regularly communicate for the purposes of collaboration,
comparisons of publications, and to provide help and feedback to others.

![](constitution_red_thread.png "constitution_red_thread.png"){width="601"
height="400"}

This Constitution, moreover, is intended to be:

1.  A specific constitution for the XLP
2.  A meta constitution, providing a template for all societies and
    organisations worldwide

This constitution is worded such that any society or organisation will
be able to apply this constitution to their own structure simply, by
replacing a few specific words and phrases in the constitution. This
constitution therefore is both specific and generic, and is easily
scalable.

Officer Meetings (OMs), for instance, is one specific to XLP, but can be
generalised to any organisation. There will be meetings held by Officers
(Smart Contract leaders) at least once per month. They will have a
quorum, a minimum attendance for the meeting to proceed. Every Officer
must (virtually) attend a minimum of 10 meetings per year in order to
stay in the position. This will be where all the Officers will discuss
any important changes to individual teams and to the XLP as a whole, and
welcome new Officers. This will also be the case where appeals can be
formally discussed, debated and voted upon. Contributors, Treasurers and
Secretaries can observe but cannot participate until the Member
Questions section at the end of the Officer Meeting.

![](constitution_meeting.png "constitution_meeting.png"){width="355"
height="348"}

The Officer of the team will be the one who creates the mission. She or
he then edits the Smart Contract template which will govern the specific
responsibilities of every other member in the team. Each member must
digitally sign with biometric authentication in order to become members
of this team. Once signed, any member of the team may self-nominate to
become Secretary or Treasury. By process of a Single Transferable Vote
secret ballot across the entire team, the Treasurer and Secretary will
be elected.

### The Constitution of The XLP

Last Revised: 3^rd^ August 2018

#### Article I -- Objective

The Objective of the XLP is to catalyse learning processes by
facilitating digital crowd-learning activities.

#### Article II -- Purpose and aims

The XLP exists and aims to:

1.  Measure and improve organisational learning
2.  Implement Logic models at and within each stage of the learning
    process
3.  Recursively adapt and improve the XLP through adjustment and review
4.  Expand the boundaries of coverage to the geographical and
    technological frontiers of learning

#### Article III -- The Constitution

This document serves as the constitution of the XLP. This Constitution
is subject for review not less than quinquennially. This constitution
abides by the rule of law. All previous constitutions are hereby
revoked.

#### Article IV -- Smart Contracts

1.  In addition to this constitution, members shall be governed by a
    smart contract.
2.  Using a generic template, each Officer, defined in Article VI, shall
    write the specifics of the Smart Contract.
3.  To be a member of the team, a member must digitally sign the smart
    contract with biometric authentication.
4.  The Treasury and Secretary will then be chosen by a Single
    Transferable Vote secret ballot of all self-nominated members.
5.  Blockchain technologies shall be used to codify, automate, assign,
    and evaluate the specific privileges and responsibilities of each
    member within each contract. The operation of smart contracts will
    therefore function as a decentralised autonomous organisation.
6.  All smart contracts operate in addition to, as opposed to in
    replacement of, this constitution; no smart contract may infringe on
    any liberty or responsibility laid out in this constitution.
7.  This constitution shall always be consulted before any other
    document, and is of paramount importance.

#### Article V -- Membership

1.  Membership of the XLP belongs to any agent (virtual or physical) who
    possesses the correct account credentials, verifiable by biometric
    identification
2.  Membership belongs to accounts and only accounts of the XLP. Each
    account shall have a unique character string in hash. This is the
    membership number of each account, and cannot be replicated
3.  If account details are somehow stolen, any subsequent transactions
    immediately become null and void. A member shall give immediate
    public notice upon realising their account interference
4.  Membership has an identical lifespan to its associated account. An
    account expires after 30 consecutive days without being governed by
    a Smart Contract. For Officers this expiry is after 90 consecutive
    days
5.  Members shall have the right to terminate their membership at any
    time, by publicly declaring their intention so to do. Unless a
    mutual agreement takes place, the smart contract will remain valid
    until its official expiry
6.  Any individual can become a member of the Group through official
    recognition of any XLP-partner university, or by official
    appointment in an Officer Meeting
7.  Membership becomes official only through a digital signature below a
    most recent copy of this constitution

#### Article VI -- Roles

Every member of the XLP has two roles. Firstly, all members are either a
Mission Designer or a Mission Executer; the responsibilities for both
are in line with the overall objective of the XLP:

1.  Mission Designer: Members who design and test learning missions in
    accordance with the goals of sponsors, tailored for Mission
    Executers based on the available resources and requirements
2.  Mission Executer: Members who participate in the missions designed
    by Mission Designers, continuously learning to execute at a high
    level of complexity or speed, and guiding others to perform each
    mission

In addition, each member has one of the following additional roles
within each team:

1.  Officer: The leader and representative of the team in all
    communication
2.  Treasurer: The operator of the team's budget and finances
3.  Secretary: The organiser of the team's administration
4.  Contributor: Any and all members of the team who do not belong to
    one of the above three categories

#### Article VII -- Responsibilities

In addition to the responsibilities laid out in the relevant Smart
Contact for a member's team, each member's roles include overarching
responsibilities laid out in this constitution. In every instance, the
responsibilities laid out in this constitution are paramount. The
responsibilities are the following:

Mission Designer:

1.  To collectively design a mission and learning opportunity that
    facilitates learning by replication
2.  To begin by writing a logic model for the entire course
3.  To follow the customised logic model for the design of the mission
    specification
4.  To create a mission that is challenging but rewardable for the
    Mission Executers
5.  To provide regular updates and feedback of the progress of Mission
    Executers
6.  To communicate with Mission Designers across teams for mutual
    inspiration and advice
7.  To follow instruction from the Officer on designing of the mission
8.  To transfer the mission to Mission Executers upon completion,
    continuously updating the mission with fixes and feature upgrades
9.  To conduct a review with Mission Executers at the end of the course,
    evaluating the course effectiveness and opportunities for learning
    development

Mission Executer:

1.  To follow the mission as set out by the Mission Designers
2.  To work collaboratively with other Mission Executers to follow the
    mission
3.  To communicate with Mission Executers across teams for mutual
    inspiration and advice
4.  To provide feedback to Mission Designers on the quality and
    effectiveness of the mission

    shall always be decisive, unless specified elsewhere in this
    constitution
4.  Any member of the XLP can observe any Officer Meeting, and may
    participate in Member Questions
5.  At any point during any Officer Meeting, any member can call for
    quorum. If there exists fewer than 75% of all Officers present, the
    meeting immediately terminates, and will be replaced with one the
    next Thursday at the same time. An inquorate meeting does not count
    towards an Officer's minimum attendance of at least ten Officer
    Meetings annually

        discuss with the other Officers
    3.  Appeals. If of great significance, an appeal may reach the stage
        to be voted on in an Officer Meeting. Unless an appeal
        explicitly refers to the Officer, an Officer may represent any
        team member concerned. The matter will be debated, and a vote
        between Officers will take place in the form of a secret ballot.
        By majority rule, an official decision shall be reached
    4.  Miscellaneous items. Any items that do not fall into any of the
        above categories will be discussed, and, where necessary, voted
        on
    5.  Member Questions. Members, selected by ballot, will have the
        opportunity to ask questions to any or all Officers, for an

        minutes in total

#### Article X -- Complaints

1.  Should a member have cause for complaint about the administration of
    their team or the XLP, the provision of services thereby, or the
    conduct of Officers, and register that complaint in the form of a
    letter to their Officer, that Officer shall constitute a tribunal to
    investigate the complaint with all deliberate speed

    Tribunal shall investigate the veracity and accuracy of the
    complaint, and present a report at the next Officer meeting in the
    Appeals section. Should the tribunal uphold the complaint, the next
    Officer Meeting must ensure that action is taken to resolve it
4.  If the Tribunal concludes that a member has breached this
    Constitution in any way, a vote of no confidence in that member must
    be held at the next Officer Meeting
5.  Should either party to the complaint wish to appeal, they may have
    recourse to their team's Secretary, who will investigate and report
    on the complaint at an Officer Meeting as soon as practicable.

#### Article XI - Amendments & Dissolution

1.  Amendments to the Constitution shall be made in Officer Meetings
    only. An amendment can be proposed by any Officer, and all members,
    not only Officers, may vote on and amend an amendment. The vote
    shall be held by secret ballot with the Single Transferable Vote
    electoral system. Any amendment requires a majority vote in two
    consecutive Officer Meetings reaching quorum to be changed into the
    Constitution, and will apply immediately once the second vote has a
    majority in proposition
2.  Members shall leave the XLP at any point as set out in Article V
3.  If a situation arises where the XLP must or wishes to dissolve, it
    requires two majority votes of at least 80% in two consecutive
    Officer Meetings reaching quorum. The vote will be held by secret
    ballot with the Single Transferable Vote electoral system. Any
    member virtually present may vote on the notion to dissolve the XLP.
    A proposition to dissolve the XLP may be proposed by any Officer in
    any Officer Meeting

How to: Use MediaWiki
---------------------

You will use the wiki to group edit your report and other documents.

A wiki is a website on which users collaboratively modify content and
structure directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is
written using a simplified markup language.

Wikipedia is by far the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of
the most widely viewed sites of any kind in the world, having been
ranked in the top ten since 2007. There are tens of thousands of other
wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis functioning as
knowledge management resources, notetaking tools, community websites,
and intranets. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection
of articles; as of September 2016, it had over five million articles.

We use [Mediawiki](Mediawiki "wikilink"), the same software that runs
Wikipedia, to allow participants to collaboratively create reports and
other documents.

### Log In

Click on **OAuth2Login** on the top right of your MediaWiki install.
Your coordinator should have given you the address.

![](Mediawiki_login.png "Mediawiki_login.png"){width="700"}

### Create a New Page

1.  Go to <http://>*yourwebsite.com*/index.php/*page\_title* where
    *page\_title* is the name of the page you want to create.
2.  Click **Create**\
    \
    ![](Mediawiki_create.png "fig:Mediawiki_create.png"){width="700"}
3.  Write in your text as needed. Don\'t worry about adding a title,
    since the title will be the name of your page.
4.  Write a one sentence summary in the **Summary** box, and then click
    **Save changes**.\
    \
    ![](Mediawiki_summary.png "fig:Mediawiki_summary.png"){width="700"}

### Edit a Page

You can edit any page on the wiki, including the front page:

1.  Go to the page you want to edit.
2.  Click **Edit** at the top of the page.
3.  After making changes, write a one sentence summary in the
    **Summary** box, and then click **Save changes**.

### Format Text and Insert Images

Mediawiki uses [wikitext](wikitext "wikilink") to format text, create
lists, insert images, and so on. Instead of a graphical editor like
Microsoft Word, you use a plain text box with special wikitext codes to
turn text into headers or lists, and insert images:

#### Bold and Italic

    '''Bold'''
    ''Italic''

#### Headings

    = Heading Level 1 =
    = Heading Level 2 =
    == Heading Level 3 ==

And so on\...

#### Lists

    * Bullet 1
    * Bullet 2
    ** Sub bullet
    *** Sub sub bullet

    # Numbered list item 1
    # Numbered list item 2
    ## Numbered list item 2.1
    ### Numbered list item 2.1.1

#### Links

External links:

    [http://www.link.com Link Title]

For example:

    [https://news.wisc.edu/curiosities-what-determines-the-colors-of-the-sky-at-sunrise-and-sunset/ Curiosities: What determines the colors of the sky at sunrise and sunset?]

Links on your own wiki

    [[Page title]]

For example:

    [[Digital Wallet]]

Renaming a link on your own wiki:

    [[Page name | Text you want]]

#### References

    The sky is blue<ref>Steven Ackerman, professor of meteorology at UW–Madison</ref>

You can also embed links into citations (see above for link syntax)

#### Insert Images

1.  Click **Upload File** on the left sidebar\
    \
    ![](Mediawiki_upload_1.png "fig:Mediawiki_upload_1.png"){width="200"}
2.  Browse for your file and click the **Upload file** button.\
    \
    ![](Mediawiki_upload_3.png "fig:Mediawiki_upload_3.png"){width="700"}
3.  When you\'re editing a page and want to insert the image, type:
        [[File:filename.png]]

    If the image is too big, you can use

        [[File:filename.png|500px]]

    to make it 500 pixels wide, for example.

How to: Use WordPress and Elementor
-----------------------------------

A blog (short for \"weblog\") is a discussion or informational website
consisting of posts (diary-style updates, displayed newest-first) and
pages (more permanent information).[^33]

Our blogging software is [WordPress](WordPress "wikilink"): a free and
[open-source](open-source "wikilink") content management system. It is
most associated with blogging, but supports other types of web content
including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries,
and online stores. Used by more than 60 million websites, including
30.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2018, WordPress is the
most popular website management system in the world.[^34]. Our WordPress
installation includes several plugins to make editing easier, most
notably [Elementor](https://elementor.com/).

### Log In

Your coordinator should have given you a URL, username, and password for
your WordPress installation. Use this to log in.

![](wordpress_login.png "wordpress_login.png"){width="400"}

### Create a New Report Page

One from person from each group should create the report page, based on
what your group wrote in MediaWiki:

1.  On the left-hand sidebar, you should see a link to **Pages**. Hover
    over the link and click **Add New**:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_page_new.png "fig:wordpress_page_new.png"){width="200"}
2.  Enter a page title, then click **Edit with Elementor** to enable a
    richer editing experience:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_page_title_elementor.png "fig:wordpress_page_title_elementor.png"){width="700"}
3.  Click the folder icon to select a template:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_elementor_template_folder.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_template_folder.png"){width="700"}
4.  Select one of the first two (free) templates:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_elementor_template_select.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_template_select.png"){width="700"}
5.  Preview your template. If you\'re happy with the overall look, click
    **Insert**:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_elementor_template_insert_button.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_template_insert_button.png"){width="200"}
6.  Start editing the \"widgets\" (i.e. components) of your template by
    clicking a widget and editing on the left sidebar:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_elementor_template_edit.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_template_edit.png"){width="700"}
7.  Insert new widgets by dragging and dropping from the left sidebar:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_elementor_template_insert.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_template_insert.png"){width="700"}
8.  When you\'re happy with the result, click **Publish**:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_elementor_template_publish.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_template_publish.png"){width="400"}

If you need to go back to the widget menu, you can click the grid icon:

![](wordpress_elementor_grid.png "wordpress_elementor_grid.png"){width="300"}

### Create a New Landing Page

All the groups should get together and nominate one person out of
everyone to create a landing page. This page gives an overview of the
whole experience and links to each team\'s report.

1.  Follow the steps above to create a new page, but don\'t publish yet
2.  You will need to create a link to each report page. This isn\'t a
    simple process unfortunately. For each report you need to create a
    link to:
    1.  Hover over the **Pages** link on the left sidebar, then
        right-click **All Pages** and click **Open in New Tab** then
        switch to that tab (this means we don\'t lose our editing work
        on our landing page)\
        \
        ![](wordpress_page_new.png "fig:wordpress_page_new.png"){width="200"}
    2.  Hover over the report page you want to create a link to. Below
        the title you should see a link to *view* the page.
        **Right-click** this, and select **Copy Link Location** (or
        whatever the menu item is called in your browser):\
        \
        ![](wordpress_page_view.png "fig:wordpress_page_view.png"){width="700"}
    3.  Go back to the tab you are using for editing your landing page
    4.  Drag and drop a button into the page, and paste the address you
        just copied into the **Link** box:\
        \
        ![](wordpress_elementor_button.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_button.png"){width="400"}\
        \
        ![](wordpress_elementor_link.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_link.png"){width="400"}\
        \
        Note: If you want to create a link another way, feel free.
        Buttons are provided as an example
3.  Repeat this process for each report you need to link to
4.  Click **Publish**:\
    \
    ![](wordpress_elementor_template_publish.png "fig:wordpress_elementor_template_publish.png"){width="400"}

### Edit a Page

1.  Hover over the **Pages** link on the left sidebar, then click **All
    Pages**\
    \
    ![](wordpress_page_new.png "fig:wordpress_page_new.png"){width="200"}
2.  Hover over the page you want to edit, then click **Edit\' with
    Elementor**\
    \
    ![](wordpress_page_edit.png "fig:wordpress_page_edit.png"){width="500"}

### Back Up Your Work

Remember Murphy\'s Law? Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. So
backup your files!

On the WordPress sidebar, click **Tools** then **Export**:

![](wordpress_export.png "wordpress_export.png"){width="200"}

Then click **Download Export File**:

![ 400px](wordpress_export_2.png " 400px")

In case of data loss or some other catastrophe, you can import this data
into a fresh WordPress installation and get your data back.

For Participants Coming to China
--------------------------------

-   Download and register on WeChat. WeChat is *THE* chat app for China,
    and everyone you meet will have it installed.
-   Download and install a VPN if you want access to Google, Facebook,
    Twitter, Youtube, WhatsApp, Line Messenger, and lots of other online
    services that are blocked in China
-   Install Google Translate for
    [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8)
    or
    [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=en)
    and the offline language pack for Chinese
-   Install [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/products/) for Chinese
    character recognition

As mentioned above, many overseas resources can only be reached via a
VPN. While using a VPN for your research is fine, we suggest you assume
your industry report, presentation anything else you create will be
accessed by users without a VPN. That means:

-   No embedded YouTube videos
-   No hosting your work on Google Drive, Dropbox, or other online
    services (OneDrive works for now, but don\'t assume it\'ll always be
    the case)
-   Disable Google Fonts in your WordPress theme (if you installed a
    theme yourself)

Also, wifi and network connections may be unreliable, so make sure
everything will run offline when you are presenting. Assume **Murphy\'s
Law**: \"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.\"

How to: Install WordPress and MediaWiki
---------------------------------------

### You will need

-   A computer running Docker
-   Access to your command line
-   Internet access for the initial container pull

### Optional First Step

Creating a Docker container requires first downloading the \"image\"
that the container is based on. A Docker image isn\'t a picture or
photograph but rather a template containing all of the files, code,
settings, and libraries required to build a container. You can make as
many Docker containers as you would like from one Docker image; any
container is just one instance of its corresponding image.

The code in the following sections automatically download the required
images, but if you have limited access to internet and would like to
download all of the images before trying to set up containers, you can
run the following lines in your command line.

     docker pull tuitu/dind-wordpress 

     docker pull tuitu/dind-mediawiki 

     docker pull tuitu/dind-piwik 

**\"pull\"** tells Docker that you want to download an image,
**\"tuitu\"** is the name of the repository where the image is stored,
and **\"dind-wordpress\"**, **\"dind-mediawiki\"**, and
**\"dind-piwik\"** are the names of the images.

### MediaWiki

MediaWiki requires MariaDB database. From your command line:

    docker run --name my_wiki -e DOCKER_DAEMON_ARGS="-D" -e PORT=4444 --privileged -d -p 80:4444  tuitu/dind-mediawiki

Docker run creates a new container. The \"\--name\" flag sets the name
of the container. The first \"-e\" flag sets the environment variable
\"DOCKER\_DAEMON\_ARGS\" to \"-D\". The 2nd \"-e\" flag sets the
environment variable \"PORT\" = 4444. The \"\--privileged\" flag gives
the container administrative rights. The \"-d\" flag is short for
\"\--detached\", this means that the container can run without being
directly controlled by a user. The \"-p\" is short for \"\--publish\",
which sets the port for the container and exposes the host port; the
first number after the \"-p\" flag \-- 80 \-- can be changed to any
available port or it can be left as the default. The last phrase
specifies which image to use for the container.

     docker exec -it  my_wiki  bash /TensorCloud/DockerInDocker/mariadb_mediawiki_4444.sh 

Docker exec runs a command on an already started container. The \"-it\"
flag is a combination of \"\--interactive\" (allows for input) and
\"\--tty\" (pseudo-terminal). The next phrase is where you specify which
container you are dealing with. In our case, this is \"my\_wiki\". The
last two phrases say to use bash (a programming language) to run a
script at the specified location. This is necessary for setting up the
internal containers.

### Wordpress

The steps for Wordpress and Piwik are similar to those of Mediawiki.

From your command line:

     docker run --name my_wordpress -e DOCKER_DAEMON_ARGS="-D" -e PORT=4445 --privileged -d -p 81:4445  tuitu/dind-wordpress 

     docker exec -it my_wordpress bash /TensorCloud/DockerInDocker/mariadb_wordpress_4445.sh 

### Piwik

    docker run --name my_piwik -e DOCKER_DAEMON_ARGS="-D" -e PORT=4446 --privileged -d -p 82:4446  tuitu/dind-piwik

    docker exec -it  my_piwik  bash /TensorCloud/DockerInDocker/mariadb_piwik_4446.sh

How to: Crowd Learn with remote participants
--------------------------------------------

While individual and group learning typically take place in just one
location at a time, large-scale crowd-learning involves participants
from all around the world. This introduces several challenges that need
to be addressed to achieve worthwhile learning outcomes. This is
especially the case when dealing with China, where many online services
are blocked.[^35]

### Why Crowd Learning?

-   **New Perspectives**: People from different countries and
    backgrounds bring new perspectives to the table
-   **Clearer Documentation**: Because all communication is electronic,
    your group learning consciousness is stored in MediaWiki, WordPress,
    and other tools

### Advice

#### For Remote/Local Teams

-   **Video chat by default**: so no one feels less valued or left out
-   **Video team-building activities**: play into the strengths of
    remote work, like sharing your classroom view
-   **Assume good intent**: Remember that the kinds of nuanced
    communication you get in a physical classroom setting don't
    necessarily translate online.
-   **Make rules**: Establish communication rules in the constitution
    that includes teams and their wishes directly in the creation. When
    to use chats? Why to write emails? At what point to pick up the
    phone? Over time these will becomes social norms for your crowd
    learning group.
-   **Build structure**: When having meetings or giving updates, have
    clear structure, process and agendas so everyone can follow along,
    no matter where they are. Assign a meeting lead and a note-taker to
    ensure key points are captured in writing.
-   **Understand each others\' contexts**: If Bob doesn\'t get an
    instant reply from Alice, it doesn\'t mean that Alice doesn\'t
    care - she may be running for a taxi in Rio!
-   **Asynchronous over synchronous**: Being in different timezones
    makes it difficult to sync up, so plan ahead and make no decisions
    last minute

#### For Remote Participants

Many remote participants feel the need to be \"visible\" in their
digital workspaces to \"prove\" that they are working.[^36]. With this
mind, remote participants can:

-   Indicate \"deep work\" times on their NextCloud (or other) shared
    calendar
-   Update your status in RocketChat or other chat tool to show they\'re
    working

### Crowd Learning Tools

All of the tools used in individual and group learning can also be used
in crowd learning, as well as several tools more specifically suited for
remote teams:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
